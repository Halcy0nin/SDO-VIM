# PHP Pseudo Framework

---

### Hello Everyone!

This PHP pseudo framework is by no means a perfect one. If you want to use this for production or anything that deals with complex functionalities, you are better off using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

By no means do I claim ownership of everything in this repository. This is a product of [learning PHP with Laracast](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners-2023-edition). All credits go to him; without his course, I could not have made this.

Lastly, I created this for fun and as a reference for my juniors if they ever want to learn how to create simple web applications using PHP and MySQL. I did this for fun, hoping that maybe someone may find this useful.

## What I Used

## How I Run
1. Open a terminal inside the directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash

3. Open your favorite code editor in the directory.
4. Enjoy learning!
